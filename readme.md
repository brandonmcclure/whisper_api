# whisper_service

A quick and basic Open AI Whisper written in python using a gradio UI and API. 

I wrote this to offload STT functionality from old or CPU only computers onto a more beefy server. This has been serving my needs well and is pretty simple so I want to share. I am open to pull requests or issues, although my primary goal for this service is to keep it simple.
